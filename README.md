# zmq_plugin

This plugin is doing approximately the same as `history_plugin`, but
instead of storing history events in the shared memory database, it
pushes them outside of `nodeos` process via ZeroMQ PUSH socket.

If wildcard filter is enabled for `history_plugin`, all account history
is stored in the same shared memory segment as the blockchain state
database. This leads to its rapid growth, up to 2GB per day, and
increased risk of node crash because of exceeded memory or disk
space. The ZMQ plugin allows processing and storing the history events
elsewhere, such as RDBMS with truncation or archiving of old entries.

The PUSH type of socket is blocking, so if nobody is pulling from it,
`nodeos` will wait forever. This is done in order to prevent skipping
any action events in the blockchain. The receiver may also route the
events to non-blocking types of sockets, such as PUB socket, in order to
let other systems listen to events on the go.



## Socket message format

1. 32-bit signed integer in host native format (little-endian on most
   platforms): `msgtype=0|1`. Zero indicates an action trace, and 1
   indicates an irreversible block information. Other values are
   reserved for future message types.

2. 32-bit signed integer in host native format:
   `msgopts=0`. Other values are reserved for future option codes.

3. JSON data.



## JSON data format (action trace, msgtype=0)

The JSON data is a map with the following entries:

1. `action_trace`: action and its corresponding inline actions, like in
   history_plugin RPC output.

2. `block_num`: block number.

3. `block_time`: block timestamp

4. `global_action_seq`: global running number of the action.

5. `currency_balances`: array of token balances for all accounts and all
   currency tokens involved in the action. Each entry is a map with
   `account_name`, `issuer`, and `balance` keys.

6. `resource_balances`: array of maps indicating current resources for
   every account involved in the action, with the keys and values as
   follows:

  * `account_name`: resource holder account;

  * `cpu_weight`, `net_weight`: staked CPU and network bandwidth in EOS,
    multiplied by 10000;

  * `ram_quota`: total RAM owned by the account, in bytes;

  * `ram_usage`: used RAM, in bytes.

Unlike `history_plugin`, this plugin does not deliver
`account_action_seq`, because that value is calculated internally by the
history plugin.


## JSON data format (irreversible block, msgtype=1)

The JSON data is a map with the following fields:

1. `irreversible_block_num`: irreversible block number.

2. `irreversible_block_digest`: block hash.
 

## JSON data format (fork, msgtype=2)

The JSON data is a map with the following fields:

1. `invalid_block_num`: block number where fork happened. All blocks
with higher or equal numbers should be discarded.


## JSON data format (accepted block, msgtype=3)

This event is pushed to the ZMQ socket preceeding transaction traces
belonging to the block. The JSON data is a map with the following
fields:

1. `accepted_block_num`: block number.

2. `accepted_block_timestamp`: block timestamp.

3. `accepted_block_producer`: block producer.

4. `accepted_block_digest`: block hash.



## JSON data format (failed transaction, msgtype=4)

The event is generated on every failed transaction, with the following
map structure:

1. `trx_id`: transaction ID.

2. `block_num`: block number;

3. `status_name`, `status_int`: textual and numeric representation of
the failure status.

Transaction status values are defined in
"libraries/chain/include/eosio/chain/block.hpp" in EOS suite as follows:

```
      enum status_enum {
         executed  = 0, ///< succeed, no error handler executed
         soft_fail = 1, ///< objectively failed (not executed), error handler executed
         hard_fail = 2, ///< objectively failed and error handler objectively failed thus no state change
         delayed   = 3, ///< transaction delayed/deferred/scheduled for future execution
         expired   = 4  ///< transaction expired and storage space refuned to user
      };
```



## Configuration

The following configuration statements in `config.ini` are recognized:

* `plugin = eosio::zmq_plugin` -- enables the ZMQ plugin

* `zmq-sender-bind = ENDPOINT` -- specifies the PUSH socket binding
  endpoint. Default value: `tcp://127.0.0.1:5556`.

* `zmq-whitelist-account = ACCOUNT` -- sets up a whitelist, so that only
  traces for specified accounts are exported. Multiple options define
  multiple accounts to trace. If the account is a contract, all its
  actions (including inline actions) are exported. Also all transfers to
  and from the account, system actions, and third-party notifications
  are triggering the trace export.



## Compiling

This plugin depends on:

* Modification in build script https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/5229


```bash
apt-get install -y pkg-config libzmq5-dev libnorm-dev
mkdir ${HOME}/build
cd ${HOME}/build/
git clone https://github.com/cc32d9/eos_zmq_plugin.git
git clone https://github.com/EOSIO/eos --recursive
cd eos

# compile EOS suite
LOCAL_CMAKE_FLAGS="-DEOSIO_ADDITIONAL_PLUGINS=${HOME}/build/eos_zmq_plugin" ./scripts/eosio_build.sh

# insttall
sudo ./scripts/eosio_install.sh
```


## Blacklists

Action `onblock` in `eosio` account is ignored and is not producing a
ZMQ event. These actions are generated every 0.5s, and ignored in order
to save the CPU resource.

System accounts, such as `eosio` and `eosio.token` and few others are
not listed in `currency_balances` and `resource_balances`.

Action `tweet` in `blocktwitter` account is blacklisted in order to
speed up re-synching with mainnet.
